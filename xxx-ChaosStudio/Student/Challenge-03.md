# Challenge 03 - Can your Application Survive an Availablity Zone Failure

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

Welocme to Challenage 3. How did your application do with pod failures? Are you still in business? Now that you have tested for pod faults and have overcome with resiliency --it is time to kick it up to the next level. Winter storms are a possiblity on Superbowl Sunday and you need to prepare for an Azure datacenter going offline. Choose your prefered region and AKS cluster to simulate an Avalability Zone failure. 
 

## Description

Create (Simulate) failure at the AKS virtual Machine level

- 
- Load and scope Chaos Experiment one of the workload's virtual machine(s) 

## Food for thought

- During the experiment, were you able to order a pizza? 
- If not, what could you do to make your application resiliant at the Avalability Zone / Virtual Machine layer? 

## Hints

-  Take note of your virutal machine's instanceID
-  All scaling should be done via AKS 

## Success Criteria

- L
