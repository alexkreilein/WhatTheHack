# Challenge 03 - Can your Application Survive an Availablity Zone Failure

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

Welocme to Challenage 3. How did your application do with pod failures? Are ya still in business? Now that you have tested for pod faults and have overcome with resiliency --it is time to kick it up to the next level. Godzilla is real and has destroyed an Avalability Zone in WestUS, your application is hosted in West-US and this couldn't happen at the worst time --SuperBowl Sunday and a Godzilla sighting! 
 

## Description

Create (Simulate) failure at the AKS virtual Machine level

- 
- Load and scope Chaos Experiment one of the workload's virtual machine(s) 

## Food for thought

- During the experiment, were you able to order a pizza? 
- If not, what could you do to make your application resiliant at the Avalability Zone / Virtual Machine layer? 

## Hints

-  Take note of your virutal machine's instanceID
-  All scaling should be done via AKS 

## Success Criteria

- L
