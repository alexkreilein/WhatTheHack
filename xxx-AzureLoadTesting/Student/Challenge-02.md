[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Pre-requisites

Before creating or using your load testing scripts, ensure you have outlined your load testing strategy as described in the previous challenge.

## Introduction

You will need to create new scripts or re-use any existing JMeter scripts and plugins.

## Description

- Ensure your scripts (new or existing) supports the load testing strategy you created in the previous challenge.
- TODO: Create load testing service in Azure

## Success Criteria

- You have one or more load testing scripts (.jmx) and relevant configuration/data files to emulate typical loads.
- Have a Load Testing Service running in Azure

## Learning Resources

- [Apache JMeter Docs](https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html)
- [Create Test Plan from Template](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#template)
- [JMeter best practices](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/best-practices.html)
- [Custom Plugins for Apache JMeter](https://jmeter-plugins.org/)

## Tips
- You may choose to create JMeter scripts in the native JMeter GUI to take advantage of the templates and other features it offers. That is out of the scope of this WTH, but you can find instructions for doing so [here](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#install).
