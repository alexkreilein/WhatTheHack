# Challenge 07 - AzureLoadTesting

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-06.md) - **[Home](../README.md)**

## Introduction (Optional)

The resiliency of an application isnâ€™t solely decided by how quickly it can scale up or out - but also how it handles failures. This means planning for a failure of every application component: a single container, cluster, VM, database and region.

## Description

- Use Azure Chaos Studio to design a Chaos experiment
- Run a load test (make sure you have a recent baseline first)
- During the load test, start the Chaos experiment and note the failures
- Prioritize the failure points and build an action plan to remediate

## Success Criteria

- Identify failure points
- Remediation plan
