# Challenge 03 - Create Azure Load Testing Service and Establish Baselines

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Pre-requisites

- Before creating your Azure Load Test service, ensure you have created your load testing script(s) in the previous challenge.
## Introduction

In this challenge you will create the Load Testing service in Azure and use the load testing scripts you created in our last challenge to run baseline tests.

Baselines help to determine the current efficiency state of your application and its supporting infrastructure. Baselines can provide good insights for improvements and determine if the application is meeting business goals. Baselines can be created for any application regardless of its maturity. No matter when you establish the baseline, measure performance against that baseline during continued development. When code and, or infrastructure changes, the effect on performance can be actively measured.

## Description

- Create a Load Testing service in Azure.
- Run your load test using a typical user load and establish a performance baseline.
- Make sure your script is parametarized and can be used against multiple environments.
- Use your baseline data to set your test pass/fail criteria.
- Discuss where you may be able to leverage this baseline data you have gathered.

## Success Criteria

- Create an Azure Load Testing Service
- Run your load tests and establish a baseline
