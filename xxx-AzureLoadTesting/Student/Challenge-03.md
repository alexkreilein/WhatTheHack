# Challenge 03 - Establish Baselines

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-02.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-04.md)

## Introduction

First, establish performance baselines for your application. Then, establish a regular cadence for running the tests. Run the test as part of a scheduled event or part of a continuous integration (CI) build pipeline. 

Baselines help to determine the current efficiency state of your application and its supporting infrastructure. Baselines can provide good insights for improvements and determine if the application is meeting business goals. Baselines can be created for any application regardless of its maturity. No matter when you establish the baseline, measure performance against that baseline during continued development. When code and, or infrastructure changes, the effect on performance can be actively measured.

## Description

Run your load test using a typical user load and establish a performance baseline

## Success Criteria
